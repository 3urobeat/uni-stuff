# python-calculator
This is a simple, multi line, python calculator which we had to do at the Uni.  
It accepts multi line inputs from stdin, calculates each line and outputs to stdout.  
Numbers and Operators can be described with german words as well (fuenf = 5, plus = +, etc.).  
Brackets are not supported, anything NaN or not an operator will be cleaned from the input.  

Input example:  
`$ fuenf minus sieben mal sechs HALLOdurch autodrei plus 7sechs=` results in `67`.  

More test cases with input & expected output can be found in the folder `tests`.
